# My Engineering Thesis: 
# Development and implementation of an application for recognizing food products using artificial intelligence and a culinary recipe recommendation system

## Overview
This mobile application, developed using **React Native** and **Python**, uses **artificial intelligence** to recognize food products and suggest recipes based on detected ingredients. The app utilizes a trained **YOLO model** for object detection and integrates with the **external API** to fetch recipe recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **AI Model:** YOLOv11

## Features
✅ Food recognition using a deep learning model  
✅ Recipe recommendations based on detected ingredients  
✅ Built for mobile devices  
✅ Uses Flask to run the AI model
